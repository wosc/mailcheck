CHANGES
=======

1.0.3 (2019-02-26)
------------------

- Catch smtp/imap errors and exit, so we don't produce output on stdout (which
  is annoying in cronjobs).


1.0.2 (2018-04-08)
------------------

- Fix typo in console script name.


1.0.1 (2018-04-07)
------------------

- Fix typo because smtplib.starttls has `context` and imaplib.starttls has
  `ssl_context` as the kw name, sigh.


1.0.0 (2018-04-07)
------------------

- First release.
